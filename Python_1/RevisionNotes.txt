Revision Pyhton basics:
In python data takes the form of objects, hence there are loosely typed language.
Python conceptual Hierarchy:
1.Programs consists of modules.
2.Module contains statements.
3.Statements contains expressions.
4.Expression create process objects

Object Types in Python:
Numbers- 12345,3.14145,0b111,Decimal(),Fraction()
Strings- 'spam',"Bob's"
Lists- [1,2],[1,2,'three',F]
Dictionaries- {'food':'spam','taste':'yum'},dict(hours=10)
Tuples- (1,'spam',4,'U'),tuple('spam'),namedtuple
Files- open('eggs.txt'),open(r'C:\bin\ham,dat','wb')
Sets- set('abc'),{'a','b','c'}
Other core types- boolean,types,None
Program unit types- Function,module,classes.
Implemetation related classes- Compiled code, stack tracebacks

Numbers:
Integer Addition
Floating Point operations- If you mention floating point one of your expression it will give result in floating point only.
Power operator in pyhton is ** 
String:
String supports operations that assume a positional ordering among items.
S-'spam'
len(S)--4
S[0]-s
S[-1]-last item from the end
S[-2]-second last item from the end
S[1:3]-Slice of S from offsets 1 through 2
S[1:]-evertyhing past the first (1:len(S))
pam
S[0:3]-everythning bu the last
S[:-1]Everything but the last i.e. the simpler vevrsion of the above example
Note: Strings in oyhton are immutable you cannot change the object after first assignment.
We can run expressions to make new objects
S='z'+S[1:]
Numbers, Strings and tuples are immutable
