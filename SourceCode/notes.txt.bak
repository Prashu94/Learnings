Predctive Modelling
----------------------------------

1. What is predictive modelling?
----------------------------------
Predict the outcome of the next events using the historical data

i.Supervised Learning: There is dependent variable present in the data and you can do the prediccation.
Example: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decison Tree, Random Forest.
ii.Unsupervised Learning: There is no dependent variable present in the data, hence we need to find the pattern and segment the data.
Example: Cluster Anlaysis, Market Basket Anlaysis, Associative Anlaysis.

Dependent Variable: What we are predicting
Independent variable: Estimator variable, helps in predicting the dependent variable

Example: 
---------------------------------
Linear Regression:

Used to establish the relationship between the dependent and independent variable
i.Simple Linear Regression: One dependent variable and one independent variable
ii.Multiple Linear Regression: One dependent variable and more than one independent variable

Project: Real Estate :
BP: To predict the selling proce of the house
BS: To build the linear regression

Advertising data set: 

Input Varaible/Independent variable: TV, radio, newspaper(budgets)
Ouput Variable: Sales

Y=f(x) +c

x=(x1,x2,x3,x4,...,xp)

We need to estimate the function variable as it helps to estimate the varibales good for predication

This can be done through Y1=f(x)1+e

The accuracy of Y1 as a prediction for Y depends on two quantiles:
reducible error 
irreducible error


In general f1 cannot be a perfect estimat of f and this inaccuracy will introduce some error which is called as reducible error 

Y1=f(x)1

E(Y-Y1)^2= E[f(x) + e - f(x)1]^2
	 = [f(x) - f(x)1]^2 +Var(e)
[f(x) - f(x)1]^2= Reduible Error
Var(e)= Irreducible Error
E(Y-Y1)^2= Represents the average or expected value-Variance

Aim: of the above is to minimize the reducible error

Parametric Method:
1.Assumption about the functional form

f(x)= B0+B1X1+B2X2+....+BPXP

2.Once we have assumed the f is linear we need a procedure that use the training data to fit or train the model
Here we need to estimate the parameters B0,B1,....,BP i.e
We need tho find the value of these poarameters such that 
Y ~ B0+B1X1+B2X2+...+BPXP

The most common approach to fit the model is referrd to as Least Squared Value

For Example:

income = B0 +B1 * Education+ B2 * Seniority

Non-Parametric Method:





-------------------------------------------
Instructor notes:
When Dependent variable is continous then linear regression

Multiple Linear REgression:
Y=B0+B1X1+B2X2+B3X3+BBXXN+Error

Y=Dependent Variable:Selling Price of the house
B0=Intercept
B1=Slope for X1(X1 is first independent variable)
X1=First independent variable(LSP)
X2=Second Independent VAriable(Bo of bathroom)
X3=Third Indpenedent Variable(Area of Site)

Model Interpretation:

1.Look at the p-values
2.pvalues< 0.05 all those variable are significant 
3.(Estimate column)Look at the slope of the significant variable
4.Establish the relationship between significant varibale and dependent variable 
5.Look at the square values
Cut off RSQ value is 70%
RSQ:  Model A :RSQ:95%
Model B: RSQ -50%
Adjusted RSQ value < RSQ


It means that 95% of the selling price of the house is explained by xyz independent variable
size of the living space

sellingprice and the predictied selling price
error = sellingprice-predicted selling price

-ve -profit

Logistic Regression Model:

When dependent varibale is binary(TRUE/FALSE) then use this model

i.e if we want the output in TRUE or FALSE then use this

Project: Health Care

BP: To predict the probability of the cancer remission in the patients
BS: To build logistic regression model

Logistic Regression Equation:

LOG(P/1-P)= B0+B1X1+B2X2+B3X3+.....+BPXP
LOG(P/1-P)=Logit Function/Odd Ratio
Odd Ratio- Probability of the occurance of the events/ Prob of the occurence of the non events.

X1-CELL
X2-SMEAR

Model Building:

GLM

Model Interpretation:

1.Look at the p-values
2.pvalues< 0.05 all those variable are significant 
3.(Estimate column)Look at the slope of the significant variable
4.Establish the relationship between significant varibale and dependent variable 
5.Look at the AIC values
AIC: AKAIKES INFORMATION CRITERIA

Lower is the AIC value better is the quality of the model
Model A: AIC- 7890 
Model B: AIC- 135 

Model B is better


Binomial function is used
p q=1-p

Madam Also kindly share the datasets shared in the previous session as I had missed it.

Random forest is the best model

Decison Tree Model:

A decision tree is a treelike graph where you have different nodes like root nodes, branch and leaf nodes.

This decision tree is used to illustrate every possible outcome of a decision.

1.Root node:-  
2.Branch Node:-  
3.Leaf Node:-Result

Dependent Variable: Binary or Dichotomous
Independent VAriable: Binary of Continous

Advantage of Decision Tree:

1: It is easy to understand and interpretate
2: High Accuracy
3: Little Effort for DP(Data Preparation) when it is a decision tree.

Instructor Notes:

2.Select importnat variable from a huge dataset and then apply the model on only important varibable




#Assignments:


"HealthOne" - India's largest chain of hospitals has approached Aujas for its operational issues which the chain is facing recently. Based on the intial discussions, some of the problem area have been identified as major focus. Now, as a part of Aujas Consulting team you are required to come up with a plan on how these operational issues can be solved using data analytics. Here are few areas of conern to be focused:
a). Infrastructure Costs: Work force cost, Equipment maintenance cost etc.
b). Budget Constraint: Constrained budget has caused a delay in executing some of the expansion plans.
c). Logistics on Medicines and clinical support
d). No. of patients coming for treatment has remained constant for last two years
What are the approaches using data analytics that you would like to recommend. What kind of information (data) you would ask for your approach?

Apply function:

If we have a structered blob of data to perform operation on, i.e array/matrix
The operation may be informational or transforming, subsettting.

Syntax:
apply(m,1,mean)
apply(m,2,function(x) length(x[x>0]))

lapply- returns a list rather than a vector
sapply- returns a vector 
tapply- Apply a function to each cell of a ragged array, that is to each (non-empty) group of 
values given by a unique combination of the levels of certain factors.
